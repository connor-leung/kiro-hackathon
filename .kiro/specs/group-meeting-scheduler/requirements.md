# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Group Meeting Scheduler is a web application that analyzes iCal files from multiple participants to automatically identify optimal meeting times. The system will integrate with major calendar providers (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook Calendar) to import calendar data and suggest the best available time slots when all participants are free. The application will be deployed on Vercel and provide an intuitive interface for organizing group meetings efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want to upload iCal files from multiple participants, so that I can automatically find common available time slots for scheduling meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads multiple iCal files THEN the system SHALL parse and validate each file format
2. WHEN iCal files are processed THEN the system SHALL extract busy/free time information for each participant
3. WHEN parsing fails for any file THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which file and what went wrong
4. WHEN files are successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation with participant count and date range covered

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want to connect directly to major calendar providers, so that I can import calendar data without requiring manual file downloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Google Calendar integration THEN the system SHALL authenticate via OAuth and import calendar data
2. WHEN a user selects Apple Calendar integration THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for iCal export or direct connection if available
3. WHEN a user selects Outlook Calendar integration THEN the system SHALL authenticate via Microsoft Graph API and import calendar data
4. WHEN calendar integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and clear troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN calendar data is imported THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and only access necessary scheduling information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want the system to analyze all participants' calendars and suggest optimal meeting times, so that I can quickly identify when everyone is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar data is processed THEN the system SHALL identify all time slots where all participants are free
2. WHEN analyzing availability THEN the system SHALL consider configurable meeting duration (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.)
3. WHEN multiple time slots are available THEN the system SHALL rank suggestions based on preferences (business hours, time zones, etc.)
4. WHEN no common free time exists THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative options with minimum conflicts
5. WHEN time zone differences exist THEN the system SHALL display suggestions in each participant's local time zone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want to specify meeting preferences and constraints, so that the suggested times align with practical scheduling needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a meeting search THEN the system SHALL allow specification of preferred time ranges (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM)
2. WHEN configuring preferences THEN the system SHALL support different time zones for participants
3. WHEN setting constraints THEN the system SHALL allow exclusion of weekends or specific days
4. WHEN preferences are applied THEN the system SHALL filter suggestions accordingly and explain why certain times were excluded
5. WHEN buffer time is specified THEN the system SHALL account for travel time or preparation time between meetings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to view suggested meeting times in my local time zone with calendar integration options, so that I can easily confirm my availability and add the meeting to my calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing meeting suggestions THEN the system SHALL display times in the participant's detected or selected time zone
2. WHEN a meeting time is selected THEN the system SHALL generate calendar invites compatible with major calendar applications
3. WHEN confirming availability THEN the system SHALL provide one-click calendar integration to add the meeting
4. WHEN multiple participants need to confirm THEN the system SHALL track responses and update availability in real-time
5. WHEN conflicts arise after confirmation THEN the system SHALL notify all participants and suggest alternative times

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be fast, secure, and accessible from any device, so that I can efficiently schedule meetings regardless of my technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard internet connections
2. WHEN handling calendar data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit and at rest
3. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
4. WHEN calendar data is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL automatically delete temporary data within 24 hours
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be accessible via HTTPS with proper SSL certificates
6. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL work across modern browsers without requiring plugins
